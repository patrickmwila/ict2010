# PSEUDOCODE AND ALGORITHMS 

## PSEUDOCODE
* An outline of a computer program, written in a mixture of English and 
  programming language.
* Used to plan and implement a computer program.
* It is an informal language that helps programmers develop algorithms.

## ALGORITHMS  
* Well ordered collections of unambiguous and effectively computable operations,
  that produce a specific result within a finite amout of time, when executed.

## TRAITS OF ALGORITHMS
* Well-ordered: the steps are in clear ordered.
* Uambiguous: the operations described are understood by a computing agen 
  without further simplication.
* Effectively computable: the computing agent can actually carry out the 
  operations.
* complete a task within a finite amount of time.

## METHODS OF WRITING AN ALGORITM
* Define the problem.
* List the inputs and outputs.
* Describe the steps needed to convert or manipulate the inputs to produce the 
  outputs(eg. functions).

## PSEUDOCODE CAN BE BROKEN DOWN INTO 5 COMPONENTS
* Variables
* Assignment
* Input/output
* Selection
* Repetition

## PSEUDOCODE KEYWORDS
### INPUT KEYWORDS
** GET*- input from  a keyboard
** READ*- input from a record or a file
** PROMPT*- output instruction before receiving input from a keyboard

### OUTPUT KEYWORDS 
** DISPLAY*- output to the screen
** WRITE* - send output to a record or a file
** PRINT* - send output to a printer

### ARITHMETIC KEYWORDS
** ADD (+)*- for addition
** SUBTRACT (-)- for subraction
** MULTIPLY (*)- for multiplication
** DIVIDE (/)*- for division
** ()*- for parenthesis

### ASSIGNMENT KEYWORDS
** INITIALIZE, SET*- to give a variable an initial value in pseudocode
** =*- assigning a value to a variable

### SELECTION KEYWORDS
** IF*
** ELSE IF*
** ELSE*

### LOOP KEYWORDS
** WHILE*
** DO WHILE*
** FOR*

** NB:There are various ways to write pseudocode including multiple different 
      keywords.*
**    Well designed pseudocode could be implemented in multiple different 
      programming languages*
