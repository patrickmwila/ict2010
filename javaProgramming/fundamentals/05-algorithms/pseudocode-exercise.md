# Exercise one
** Write a pseudocode that can read two numbers, multiplies them together and 
   outputs their product.*

```
## Working
1. PROMPT the user to enter first number
2. GET var_number1
3. PROMPT the user to enter second number
4. GET var_number2
5. SET var_result = var_number1 * var_number2
6. DISPLAY var_result

```

## Exercise two
** Write pseudocode that tells the user that the number they entered is not a
   5 or a 6.*
   
## Working
```
1. PROMPT the user to enter number 
2. GET var_number
3. IF (var_number != 5 && var_number != 6)
        DISPLAY "Your number is not 5 or 6"
```
## Exercise three
** Write pseudocode that reads in two numbers and displays the smaller number.*

## Working
```
1. PROMPT the user to enter number1
2. GET var_number1
3. PROMPT the user to enter number2
4. GET var_number2
5. IF (var_number1 < var_number2)
        DISPLAY "var_number 1"
   ELSE IF (var_number1 > var_number2)
        DISPLAY "var_number2"
```

## Exercise four
** Write pseudocode that will perform the following:*
    1. Read in 5 seperate numbers.
    2. Calculate the average of the five numbers
    3. Display the average if the average is above 10
    
## Working
```
1. PROMPT the user to enter number1
2. GET var_number1
3. PROMPT the user to enter number2
4. GET var_number2
5. PROMPT the user to enter number3
6. GET var_number3
7. PROMPT the user to enter number4
8. GET var_number4
9. PROMPT the user to enter number5
10. GET var_number5
11. SET var_average = (var_number1 + var_number2 + var_number3 + var_number4 + 
                        var_number5)/5
12. IF (var_average > 10)
        DISPLAY "var_average"
```
